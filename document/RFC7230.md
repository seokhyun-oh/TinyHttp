### HTTP
- stateless application-level request/response protocol
- self-descriptive

### Client/Server Messaging
- reliable transport or session layer connection
- one or more requests, one or more responses (batch request)
- request = request line + header fields + empty line + message body
- response = status line + header fields + empty line + message body

### Intermediaries
- Must send their own HTTP-version in forwarded messages
- Proxy : message-forwarding agent, selected by the <b>client</b>
- Gateway : reverse proxy, forwards requests to another server(s)
- Tunnel : blind relay without changing the messages. (TLS)

### Version
- Recipients allow unrecognized header fields to be safely ignored
- A server must not send a version to which it is not conformant. (send 505)
- A client may send a lower request version after it received 505 status from the server
